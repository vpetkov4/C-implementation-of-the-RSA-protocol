# C++-implementation-of-the-RSA-protocol
This is a C++ implementation of the RSA encryption protocol.

This file implements the RSA protocol as a class in C++. It also defines a method to encrypt text from a file and to save the encrypted message into a file. Finally, it implements a simple interface that allows the user to choose to 
1): Generate their own cypher
2): Break a public cypher (if the involved primes are small)
3): Encrypt or decrypt a message from the interface
4): Decrypt a message from a file or save their encrypted message to a file.
